A series of basic Hangman programs originally based on skeleton code by Mr M. Scott at Brighton College.

v1: Still uses one keyword "apple"

v2: Uses file reading to choose a random word from a text file

test_hangman1: A task to introduce automated unit testing

test_hangman2: A task to create several instances of the game and check the asterisk production and the guesses is correctly decremented
